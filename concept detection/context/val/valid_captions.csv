The stomach is indicated with a black arrow and the left hepatic lobe is marked LSH. The dimensions of the tumor in cm are specified at the bottom left. No other pathological changes were identified by ultrasound. Submucosal tumors, also known as mesenchymal tumors, are a group of tumors that contain spindle-shaped cells [1]. They are classified histopathologically as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), tumors originating from smooth muscle tissue, which, in turn, includes leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, and tumors originating from nervous tissue. The latter category includes schwannomas, granular cell tumors, and neurofibromas [2]. Gastric schwannoma is a tumor that originates from the nerve plexus of the intestinal wall [3]. More specifically, this tumor originates from Schwann cell sheaths and represents 0.2% of all gastric tumors [4]. Most commonly, gastric schwannoma originates from the Auerbach plexus, located in the smooth muscle layer of the gastric wall, and less commonly from the Meissner submucosal plexus. As it grows, the tumor pushes the nerve to the periphery, with no change in neuronal function [5]. This tumor is most often benign and is more common in women between the ages of 5060 [4,6]. We present the case of a 56-year-old asymptomatic patient who was diagnosed, following a routine ultrasound examination, with an abdominal tumor. The ultrasound appearance of the tumor is presented in Figure 1."

The 57-year-old woman came to our outpatient clinic because of a slow-growing median cervical swelling that had been present for more than 14 months. She complained of mild neck discomfort without frank dysphagia or dyspnea. Upon physical examination, the subcutaneous swelling was soft and nontender, it was partially mobile on swallowing, and there were no signs of infection or inflammation. Her medical history included seasonal allergic rhinitis, nodular osteoarthritis of the hands, primary Sjogrens syndrome, and a recent diagnosis of euthyroid Hashimotos thyroiditis. There were no known allergies nor she was taking any medication. A full ear, nose, and throat evaluation was uneventful, and the cranial nerves function assessment was normal. In particular, transnasal fiberoptic flexible examination revealed regular oropharyngeal and laryngeal structures with no pooling secretions, and normal swallowing phases for both solids and liquids. In the suspicion of a TGD cyst, an initial ultrasound (US) examination was requested and it revealed a non-cystic hypoechoic mass with scattered hyperechoic spots and a normal-looking thyroid gland; no lymphadenopathies were present. Subsequently, CT and MRI were both ordered in the diagnostic work-up."

The anatomical subsite pinpoints to a possible persistence of the thyroglossal duct (TGD). This represents an embryological remnant during the migration of the endodermal thyroid diverticulum, and it may extend from the foramen cecum of the base of the tongue to the suprasternal notch [1,2,3]. TGD can variably persist in up to 7% of the adult human population, and its incomplete obliteration (usually by the tenth week of gestation) leads to the creation of the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland as well as many other neck disorders, including lingual thyroiditis and TGD cyst [4]. The latter in particular is the most frequent congenital central neck mass and it usually presents around 3040 years of age as an infected cyst (more rarely as a fistula or a sinus), causing neck discomfort and dysphagia [5,6]. Their treatment usually consists of open surgical excision along with the central portion of the hyoid bones body and a core of tongue musculature, as described in 1920 by Walter E. Sistrunk from the Mayo Clinic [7]. The differential diagnosis of TGD cysts and midline masses is vast and it includes, among others, dermoid and epidermoid cysts, cystic nodal metastases of papillary thyroid carcinoma, lymphangiomas, lymphomas, ectopic thyroid adenomas, or lipomas [4,8]."

Subcutaneous heparin was discontinued, and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cell transfusion (PRBC) and underwent angiogram with gel foam embolization of the left L3 lumbar artery. Since the patient continued to have a persistent drop in hemoglobin to 7.9 g/dl 2 days after embolization, he was taken back to the operating room for a second embolization. Between the first and second embolization, he received desmopressin 4 mcg IV once as his BUN was 118 mg/dl. Although he underwent a second embolization, point-of-care thromboelastography (TEG) with platelet mapping in the presence of heparinase was performed as the suspicion of uremic platelet dysfunction was high. It showed decreased platelet aggregation (11.9) and increased inhibition (68.1), as shown in Figure3A  confirming our diagnosis. Hemodialysis was initiated, and after three dialysis treatments, TEG was repeated, showing an improvement in the parameters ( Figure3B )."

ImageCLEFmedical_Caption_2025_valid_16344,"In the case reported, a 34-year-old woman, pregnant for the first time and with no significant medical history or consanguineous marriage, was referred to our fetal medicine department at 37 weeks of gestation for an intraabdominal hyperechoic image assessment. She was Resus-positive, and CMV-immune. Upon ultrasound examination, we identified a hyperechoic tubular structure at the level of the gallbladder without any additional malformation. The patient was informed about the diagnosis of fetal cholelithiasis and its potential implications. She had already been counselled about the association with cystic fibrosis and had the CFTR gene mutation tested. She was not a carrier of the mutation. The image is a cross-sectional view of the fetal abdomen in 2D ultrasound, below the level of the stomach, showing a hyperechoic tubular structure in the fetal abdomen with no colour Doppler signal. This is a highly suggestive image of fetal cholelithiasis. Meconium peritonitis was considered within the spectrum of potential diagnoses; this condition occurs when the fetus experiences intrauterine bowel perforation, leading to the accumulation of meconium (the first stool) within the abdominal cavity. It can cause calcifications within the abdomen. However, it was ultimately excluded as a plausible aetiology due to the absence of concomitant findings, such as elevated amniotic fluid volume (polyhydramnios) or bowel dilation. Fetal cholelithiasis can be caused by fetal hepatitis (CMV infection), haemolytic disorders, polycythemia and biliary atresia, or the condition can be idiopathic [1,2,3,4]. Furthermore, biliary disorders, including gallbladder and bile duct disease, are common complications of cystic fibrosis. Therefore, genetic consultation and proper testing for the parents and the fetus are highly recommended after the detection of abdominal hyperechoic structures [1]. The diagnosis was confirmed by abdominal ultrasound but resolved by the 2-month follow-up. Fortunately, there were no additional malformations detected during the scan, and the baby did not experience jaundice or any other complications during the neonatal period. This positive outcome suggests that the gallstones were a transient issue and that the baby is on a healthy developmental trajectory."

ImageCLEFmedical_Caption_2025_valid_16449,"Ultrasound sonography (US) of the neck. Neck US reveals an enlarged lymph node with internal cystic change at left level III. A few cases of non-malignant inclusions were detected in lymph nodes removed from a patient with malignancies. For example, benign salivary glands in the pulmonary hilar lymph node, benign epithelial tissue, nevus cells in the axillary node, and benign Mullerian inclusions in the pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes have been found [1,2,3,4,5]. There have been many reports since the first report of an intranodal inclusion of benign thyroid tissue in 1897, but the origin and mechanism of intranodal thyroid tissue are not clear [6,7,8,9,10]. Furthermore, there have been few radiographic pathological reports of very extensive cystic changes in benign thyroid tissue in the lymph nodes. A 47-year-old male patient visited the hospital 3 years ago complaining of discomfort in the left side of the neck. Ultrasound sonography (US) revealed thyroid nodules of various sizes with bilateral cystic changes. The thyroid function test was normal with T3 0.66 ng/mL, Free T4 1.36 ng/dL, and TSH 1.48 uIU/mL. Fine needle aspiration was performed to confirm nodular hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. Three months later, the size of the thyroid gland had increased. Therefore, direct injection of ethanol through the needle for the atrophy of a thyroid mass, the so-called ethanol sclerotherapy [11], was performed. The following day, he had trouble breathing with fever, chills, and myalgia. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a purulent cystic mass with conglomerated lymph nodes in the left neck. WBC 14,530/L, ESR 120 mm/h, and CRP 39 mg/L were observed in the blood tests. A purulent abscess was clinically suspected and subtotal left lobectomy was performed along with abscess removal. An abscess of the neck and nodular hyperplasia of the thyroid gland were confirmed histologically. Four months later, a mediastinal mass was detected, and an invasive thymoma was diagnosed via total thymectomy. US of the neck performed 2 months prior showed enlarged lymph nodes at left neck levels II and III, and increased blood flow in the solid part (Figure 1). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative, and the BRAF V600E mutation was not detected. CT of the neck revealed multiple nodular lymph node masses from left neck levels II, III, and IV to the superior mediastinum (Figure 2)."

DPED symmetrically transitions into the detachment of the IS/OS photoreceptor junction, localized between the two arrows, where the beginning and end of junction detachment are indicated. In addition, the detached IS/OS photoreceptor junction shows uneven reflectivity and thickness of the retinal layer, a sign of incipient degenerative changes of the IS/OS junction, which are considered to be the result of the lack of junction nutrition due to its increased distance from the RPE [10, 11]."
